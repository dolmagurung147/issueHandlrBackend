# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# dolma = Employee.create(name: 'dolma', employeeNo: 2001, role: "junior developer")
# michael = Employee.create(name: 'michael', employeeNo: 2002, role: "junior developer")
# elizabeth = Employee.create(name: 'elizabeth', employeeNo: 2003, role: "junior developer")
# brianna = Employee.create(name: 'brianna', employeeNo: 2004, role: "junior developer")
# dana = Employee.create(name: 'dana', employeeNo: 2005, role: "junior developer")
# matt = Employee.create(name: 'matt', employeeNo: 2006, role: "junior developer")
